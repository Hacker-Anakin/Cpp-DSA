# C++ DSA Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to the **C++ DSA Notes**! This repository is designed to guide you through learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++** step by step. Each chapter is structured as a separate cpp file, making it easy to follow along with explanations, code examples, and exercises.

## ⚡ Installation

Before getting started, ensure you have **C++ installed** on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hacker-Anakin/Cpp-Notes.git
   cd CPP-Notes
   ```
2. **Compile the C++ files using g++:**
   ```bash
   g++ ./Chapter1.cpp
   g++ ./Chapter2.cpp
   ```
3. **Run the compiled executables:**
   ```bash
   ./Chapter1.exe
   ./Chapter2.exe
   ```
